# SFS - The Simplest (and dumbest) File Server

No packages, no npm, just node, baby.

# About

- Will truncate all file paths and just serve files from "public", so `/lol/whatever/test` becomes `test` to the server.
- ???
- Profit.

# ENV

- IP: You can pass in a listening IP here, or defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- PORT: You can pass in a listening port here, or defaults to `3001`.
